//NOTES
"dictionary" was the only correct transcription, "pockets thinks that at that" was close to the actually spoken "pocketsphinx is shit"

The radio had a lot of interference, especially when the audio jack was plugged in. A better reciever or noise removal might help

I should get a real mic, maybe I'll get better results
